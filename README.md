# Comparing Machine Learning techniques to classify news articles

Machine learning Models implemented:
 1. Multinomial Naive Bayes 
 2. Support Vector Machines 
 3. Neural Network with Softmax Layer
 
Metrics used to evaluate the performance of models:
 1. Precision
 2. Recall
 3. F1 Score 
 
Result: For all the metrics, ANN outperforms the other two.
